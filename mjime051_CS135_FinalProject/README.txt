Game is explained when playing and I hope the audio issues are fixed now. They may be loud now so make sure to start the game with a low volume and work your way up! I also left player buttons to teleport you to the begininng of each level if you press 1, 2, 3 respectively. Nothing else much to add really other than thank you for the amazing quarter. This class was really fun and although we could not go to labs and try out actual VR headsets it was still a fun class to take.
